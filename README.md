Problem Statement : Enhanced Accessibility for Students with Disabilities

=> This entails leveraging AI technologies like speech recognition, text-to-speech, and image recognition to create assistive tools. These tools transform text into spoken language, provide descriptions for images, and facilitate communication. By integrating these AI-driven solutions into educational resources, accessibility is enhanced, enabling students with disabilities to engage more effectively with learning materials and fostering a more inclusive educational environment that accommodates diverse learning needs and abilities.

TechStack used :


1. **Tkinter**: It's a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python, which is used to create the graphical user interface for the application.

2. **SpeechRecognition**: This library provides a simple way to perform speech recognition in Python. It's used for recognizing speech input from the microphone.

3. **gtts (Google Text-to-Speech)**: It's a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API. It's used for converting text to speech.

4. **pytesseract**: It's a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. It's used for optical character recognition (OCR), converting images to text.

5. **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: It's a library for adding image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter. It's used for opening and resizing images.

6. **TensorFlow/Keras**: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework, and Keras is an API for building and training deep learning models. In this code, TensorFlow's Keras module is used to load the MobileNetV2 model for image classification.

7. **NumPy**: It's a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It's used for numerical operations, particularly for handling arrays.

8. **Filedialog**: It's a module in Tkinter that provides dialogs to open and save files.
